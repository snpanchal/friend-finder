# friend-suggester
Friend Suggester is a console application that allows a person to enter their details and get to know a list of people that are ranked based on the similarities they share with the user. I used various searching and sorting algorithms, along with appropriate data structures to quantify similarities between people and create a simple network of the user with people from the list. These people that share similarities with the user are fictional, and their details are included in the file people.txt under the files subdirectory.
